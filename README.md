This project aims to create a simple to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add, edit, and remove tasks from the list. The application will also display the status of each task (completed or not).
key features:
Task Addition: Users can enter a new task and add it to the list.
Task Removal: Users can remove completed or unwanted tasks from the list.
Task Editing: Users can edit the text or status of existing tasks.
Task Status: Each task will have a status (completed or not completed).
Persistence: The application may optionally store the to-do list data locally (using localStorage or sessionStorage) to persist it between sessions.
Additional Considerations:
User Interface: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate.
Error Handling: Implement error handling to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes.
Accessibility: Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities by following accessibility guidelines.
Responsive Design: Consider making the application responsive to different screen sizes.
